    <h1>Instruction set</h1>
    <p>Low-level languages can convert to machine code without a compiler or interpreter – second-generation programming languages use a simpler processor called an assembler – and the resulting code runs directly on the processor. A program written in a low-level language can be made to run very quickly, with a small memory footprint.

    <h2>Logic gate</h2>
    <p>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation
        on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>American Standard Code for Information Interchange</h2>
    <p>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, so it is
        the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Random-access memory</h2>
    <p>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general
        speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of
        time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Programming languages</h2>
    <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. They
        generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific
        algorithms.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Domain Name System</h2>
    <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet
        or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating
        entities.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h2>
    <p>An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. It is the foundation
        of data communication for the World Wide Web. It is the standard protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext.
